app-cat-conf(1)
===============

NAME
----
app-cat-conf - outputs a combined configuration file in a parseable
format

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'app-cat-conf' [-f <file>] [-D] [-l <location>] [-k <key>]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Outputs the combined file from all the input files. It will only
output a key once, the last value for each key seen will win.

A configuration file is a collection of grouped keys and values,
similar to Git.

The keys consits of two parts: a _group_ and a _name_. Both have to
match the regex `[a-zA-Z0-9]` and are combined with a dot.

OPTIONS
-------
-f::
  The config file to use. If the value is '-', stdin will be used as
  input. The option can be given multiple times.
-D::
  Disables the inclusion of the default files.
-k::
  Looks up the given key.
-l::
  Selects the location to use.

LOCATIONS AND DEFAULT FILES
---------------------------

'app-cat-conf' will by default look for configuration files in three places:

* '$APPSH_HOME/lib/default-config'

* '$HOME/.appconfig'

* '.app/config'

TODOs
-----

Support comments::
  1) ignore comments (lines that start with #), 2) add a flag (-C) to
  include comments in the output but still filter the lines. (2) is
  required for app-conf set to work. (1) can be done first.
Better support for scripting::
  Support _required keys_: exit with non-null value when a key is
  missing. Suggested option: '-r'.
+
Support _default values_: when a key is missing, return the default
value instead. Suggested option: '-d'.
+
Support _$APP_HOME_: If '$APP_HOME' is set, use that when reading the
app's config values. Makes it easier to script as the user may move
around directories, but still read values from the right place.
