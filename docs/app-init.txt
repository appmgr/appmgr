app-init(1)
===========

NAME
----
app-init - Installs an application

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'app-init' [-s group.name=key ...] -d <dir> <resolver> <resolver args>

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Similar to 'git clone', 'app-init' is the first command you use when
you want to deploy an application. It performs the following tasks:

1. Create the '.app' directory and the config file.
2. Initialize the resolver
3. Run 'app upgrade' to install the initial version. 'app upgrade'
   will also run any hooks defined in the application.

OPTIONS
-------

-d::
  The directory to create the application in. If the initialization
  fails, the directory will be removed.
-s group.name=key::
  Add a configuration parameter before the resolver and any hooks are
  fired.
+
This option can be given multiple times.
<resolver>::
  The name of the resolver to use. 'app-init' will search the path for
  an executable called 'app-resolver-<resolver>'.
<resolver args>::
  A list of arguments passed on directly to the resolver. See the
  documentation of the resolver you're using for more details.
